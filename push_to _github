今天提交代码，push到GitHub上，突然出现这个问题。

remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.

remote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information.

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/zhoulujun/algorithm.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

官方的解释：https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-12-git-password-authentication-is-shutting-down/

As previously announced, starting on August 13, 2021, at 09:00 PST, we will no longer accept account passwords when authenticating Git operations on GitHub.com. Instead, token-based authentication (for example, personal access, OAuth, SSH Key, or GitHub App installation token) will be required for all authenticated Git operations.

Please refer to this blog post for instructions on what you need to do to continue using git operations securely.

大致意思是，密码验证于2021年8月13日不再支持，也就是今天intellij不能再用密码方式去提交代码。请用使用 personal access token 替代
